use ifconfig to get ethernet address (wlp0s20f3)

ISE is the design suite for older xilinx fpgas
Vivado is the design suite for newer xilinx fpgas

start ise by sourcing folder:
source /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2017.2/settings64.sh

US Commercial is almost exclusively Verilog

Vivado projects should use Verilog
Legacy and ISE are better suited for VHDL

XC2 is the cool-runner-2 and can be programmed with ISE

Selecting ISim at the moment because it is the default built in simulator

Use VHDL-93 source analysis as it is better for legacy ISE support
